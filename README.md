Personal portfolio for web development. I use this site to share the projects I've been working on.

The central animation invites visitors to explore what a fourth-dimensional object would look like through a two-dimensional screen. Hyperdimensional lighting effects help visually distinguish the structure of a tesseract. Visitors can tap and drag the object to view from different perspectives in third- or fourth-dimensional space.

Rendering is accomplished through WebGL and GLSL shaders. No external libraries are used.
